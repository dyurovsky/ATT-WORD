\begin{abstract}

Children learn their first words from social partners, but it is unclear to what extent they are attuned to these partners' social cues. Some theories argue that word learning is fundamentally social from its outset, with even the youngest infants understanding intentions and using them to infer a social partner's target of reference. In contrast, other theories argue that early word learning is fundamentally a perceptual process in which young children map words onto salient objects. Only gradually do children learn the predictive power of social cues like eye gaze weigh them more than perceptual cues like visual salience. We present a set of experiments that manipulate social and salience cues to reference across development. Our results show that children gradually improve in following social cues well into their fourth year, but that this does not produce decreased attention to salience. Further, we show that social and salience cues direct attention at different times, with social cues guiding attention at all ages during learning, but salience cues playing a role at test. Together, these results suggest that the debate may be fundamentally ill-posed, and suggest a new framework for thinking about the role of salience and social cues in early word learning.

\section{Introduction}

How do young children learn the meanings of their first words? For example, when an adult produces a novel label in a complex natural scene, how can a child determine to which object---if any---the label refers \cite{Quine1960, Bloom2000}? For adults, this problem is straightforward; in addition to learning a language, adults have learned to consult a speaker’s social gestures and use their understanding of a speaker’s communicative goals \cite{Clark1983}. Social inference also characterizes the word-learning strategies of children late in their second year \cite<e.g,>{Baldwin1991, Brandone2007,Grassmann2010}. But word learning likely begins much earlier, perhaps as early as at 6-months \cite{Tincoff1999, Bergelson2012}. Do very young children use social information to reduce referential uncertainty in early word learning?

Infants are situated in a social system from their first day of life. Some theories argue that infants leverage this social information from the very outset of word learning \cite{Bloom1998, Waxman2009}. For instance, infants follow direction of gaze by 6-months \cite{D'Entremont1997} and are more likely to do so in the presence of other communicative signals \cite{Senju2008}. Further, children’s successes in following gaze predict faster vocabulary development \cite{Brooks2008}. Even more impressively, infants show some evidence of representing others’ beliefs, and these representations may affect their expectations by 7-months of age \cite{Kovacs2010}. Infants may thus become sensitive to social cues through pre-linguistic experience, and could, in principle, already use these cues from the outset of word learning \cite{Bruner1983}.

Competing theories argue that early word learning is primarily a perceptual process \cite{Vygotsky1978}. On these accounts, infants learn words by mapping them onto perceptually salient objects in their learning environments \cite{Smith2000}. Early child-directed naming events are characterized by multi-modal synchrony: mothers move the objects they label in temporal synchrony with the labels they speak \cite{Gogate2000}, and the degree of synchrony predicts word-object mapping in young infants \cite{Gogate2006}. Further, in studies that pit perceptual salience against social information (e.g., a speaker’s gaze), 10-month-old infants show no evidence of attending to gaze \cite{Pruden2006}. Although 10-month-old infants may be able to follow gaze, they seem to treat it as less important than object salience in mapping words to objects. Further, when salience and gaze conflict, providing contradictory cues to the identity of the intended referent, 12- and 15-mo olds fail to learn any mappings at all \cite{Hollich2000, Houston-Price2006}. By 19- and 24- months, however, toddlers robustly learn labels for objects cued by gaze even in the presence of salient competitors \cite{Moore1999, Hollich2000}. These findings suggest a developmental trajectory in which infants learn to learn, gradually building skill in using social cues to learn the meanings of words.

Reconciling these two classes of theories, and the diverging experimental results that support them, has proven difficult because of their different goals. The first is concerned with origins and competence, the second with constraints on performance \cite{Seidenberg1999}. A developmental trajectory in which social cues gradually gradually become more important than perceptual cues could have at least two explanations. First, as proposed by \citeA{Hollich2000}, children's word learning could initially be driven entirely by perceptual cues, but gradually social cues could take precedence. Alternatively, word learning could be social quite early---as proposed by the first class of theories---and the process responsible for the observed developmental changes could be gradual development of attentional control.

In Experiment 1 (a), the speaker turned towards one of the equally-salient toys and labeled it four times over the course of approximately 10 seconds. In Experiment 2, the speaker produced the same social cues and the same label as in Experiment 1, but the target object was either the more perceptually salient toy (b), or the less perceptually salient toy (c). Across experiments, we were thus able to determine the contributions of both salience and social information to early word learning outcomes.}
\end{figure*}

To investigate the roots of this developmental phenomenon, we designed a set of two experiments that build on previous work investigating the effects of perceptual and social cues in early word learning \cite{Hollich2000, Pruden2006}. In the first experiment, we measure children's gaze-following and word learning in a task in which the salience of the possible referents was carefully balanced for salience. After documenting the development of social word learning in the absence of salience pressures, we ran a second experiment in which the speaker's fixated referent was either more salient or less salient than the competing referent. In addition, we measured children's looking behavior not only in a preferential looking test between the two competing referents, but also during the course of learning from the speaker. Together, our results suggest that children are sensitive to a speaker's social gaze from the first half of their second year, but that this ability develops continuously through the next 3 years. In addition, our results show that while salience plays a powerful role in directing children's attention, it does so at \emph{test} rather than during learning, and its effect appears independent of age from 1-2.5 years. 

\section{Experiment 1}

In Experiment 1, we set out to measure the development of children's ability to follow and learn from social gaze in the absence of competing salience cues. Children's eye movements were tracked while they watched a series of naturalistic word-learning videos. In each, children saw a speaker seated at a table between two novel toys. She greeted them, and then turned towards one of the toys and labeled it three times in a short monologue.
After these learning trial, children were tested for their knowledge of the referent for the new word using the Looking While Listening procedure \cite{Fernald1998}. In addition, similar test trials were administered for known objects to measure children's processing of familiar words. 

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Norming}
Thirty-eight adult participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk were presented the toys two at a time and asked to select the one they would rather play with. Each participant made 20 such choices, with toys sampled at random, producing ~7.6 responses for each pair of toys. Based on these responses, we selected the two toys that were best balanced against each other (see Figure~\ref{fig:design}a).

\subsubsection{Participants}

Parents and their 1--4 year-old children were invited to participate in a short language learning study during their visit to the San Jose Children's Discovery museum. In total, we collected demographic and experimental data from 269 children, 122 of whom were excluded for one or more of the following reasons: abnormal developmental issues ($N= 27$), failure to calibrate ($N=58$), and less than 75\% exposure to English ($N=36$). The final sample consisted of 27 1-1.5 year olds (9 girls), 19 1.5-2 year olds (7 girls), 38 2-2.5 year olds (13 girls), 26 2.5-3 year olds (10 girls), 15 4-3.5 year olds (9 girls), and 22 3.5-4 year olds (11 girls).

\subsubsection{Stimuli}

The experiment consisted of two kinds of trials: learning and test. Learning trials were ~12 second video clips in which a speaker first greeted the the child, and then turned towards one of the two toys on the screen, labeling it three times in a short monologue (Figure~\ref{fig:design}a). On the first learning trial, for example, the speaker said ``Hi there! It's a \emph{modi}. Look at the \emph{modi}. What a nice \emph{modi}.''

On each test trial, children saw two objects---one on each side of the screen---and heard a short audio clip of the speaker from the learning trials asking them to find a target object. Each test trial was 7 seconds long, and the target label was heard at ~2.75s. On \emph{Familiar} test trials, both the target and distractor were common objects familiar to young children (e.g. book vs. dog). On \emph{Novel} and  \emph{Mutual Exclusivity (ME)} test trials, children saw both of the toys from the previous learning trials, and were asked to find either the previously named toy (\emph{modi}), or were asked about a novel label (\emph{dax}). 

In addition, the experiment contained two calibration checks: short videos in which small dancing stars appeared in four places on the screen. Because eye-tracker calibration can be imprecise, especially with younger children \cite{Morgante2011}, this check allowed us to adjust initial calibration settings to minimize the discrepancy between the behavior children produced and the behavior we analyzed \cite<for details, see>{Frank2012d}.

\subsubsection{Design and Procedure}

The two kinds of trials were designed to measure both how children allocate their attention over the course of learning from a social partner, and what word-object mapping information they extract from these learning events. Consequently, in addition to testing children's ability to correctly fixate the target object on Novel trials,in which they heard the label introduced during learning trials, we measured their fixation behavior when they saw the same objects but were asked to find the referent of a novel word. These Mutual Exclusivity (ME) trials provide a strong measure of children's word learning, because above-chance looking on novel trials could be result of a salience preference rather than a mapping between the word and object.

The eye-tracker was first calibrated for each child using a 2-point calibration. Next, children saw four learning trials in which the speaker produced the novel label and disambiguated her target of reference with social gaze. Finally, children saw all of the test trials, in which their knowledge of both familiar and novel word-object mappings was tested. Two calibration checks (described above) were embedded in the learning phase. The entire experiment consisted of 4 learning trials, 8 Familiar, 6 Novel, 6 Mutual Exclusivity (ME) test trials.

\subsubsection{Data Analysis}

Children's eye movements during both learning and testing were analyzed using a Regions of Interest (ROI) approach. On learning trials, bounding-box ROIs were drawn by a human coder frame-by-frame for the speaker's face and for the two objects. On test trials, a bound-box ROI was drawn for each of the two static images. To ensure that recorded eye movements were mapped to the correct ROIs, children's calibrations were first adjusted by fitting a robust linear regression for their fixations during the calibration check video and using this model to transform eye movements during the rest of the experiment \cite{Frank2012d}.

Children's learning and test behaviors were quantified by measuring their proportion of looking to each ROI on each trial. To ensure that proportions were representative, individual test trials were excluded from analysis if eye gaze data was missing for more than half of their duration. 
To compute age-group looking proportions, proportions were computed first for each individual trial, averaged at the individual-child level, and then averaged across children.

Window-of-analysis selection began by coding the point of disambiguation for each trial. This was the onset of the target label for test trials, and the rotation of the speaker's head for learning trials (marked `0' in the graphs in the Results section). The window for each trial began 1s after this point of disambiguation to allow children of all ages enough time to process and continued out to 3s after this point on both learning and test trials. To quantify learning with standard analyses, we aggregated these patterns of looking over time to compute proportion of target looking on each test trial. 

\subsection{Results}

First, evidence from two analyses suggest that children were attentive to social cues during learning at all ages measured. For all age groups, looks to both target and distractor made up the minority of children's dwell times. Instead, children in all age groups spent more than 50\% of their time attending to the speaker's face (Figure~\ref{fig:exp1_train}). Second, children were successful at attending to and following the speaker's social gaze even from the youngest ages measured. Children of all ages spent more time looking at the target than at the competitor during learning trials (smallest $t(23)  = 3.20$, $p < .01$).

Analyses of test trials showed broad success on Familiar, Novel, and ME trials across development. The 1-year-olds trended towards significance on familiar trials ($t(26)  = 1.65$, $p = .11$), and were non-significantly in the correct direction on Novel and ME trials. At all other ages, children looked to the target at above-chance levels on all test trials (smallest $t(17)  = 2.10$, $p = .05$). 

In addition, children's abilities both to follow social cues during learning trials and to find the correct target on test trials improved across development. To quantify this improvement, we fit a mixed effects logistic regression to the data \cite{Jaeger2008}. This analysis revealed significant improvement across age ($\beta = .61$, $z = 4.03$, $p <.001$), as well a significant significant effect of Learning as compared to Novel trials ($\beta = 1.18$, $z = 3.11$, $p <.01$). No other effects or interactions approached significance. Figure~\ref{fig:exp1_train_test} shows proportion of looking all kinds of trials at all ages.

\subsection{Discussion}

Together, these results provide evidence both of early competence in the use of social gaze to determine the target of a speaker's reference, as well as improvement across development. Further, improvements in gaze-following also paralleled improvements in finding the referents of these novel words on subsequent learning trials, and also finding the referents of familiar words (Figure~\ref{fig:exp1_train_test}).

At a high-level, then, these results could provide support for a cue-weighting account of the experiments in the literature. Young children could assign  small---but non-zero---weight to social cues, and then gradually assign them more credibility over development. However, at a more fine-grained level, such a cue-weighting account is unsatisfying for a number of reasons. First, children of all ages found the speaker's face highly engaging, and spent the majority of their time fixating it rather than the referents on learning trials. The primary behavioral development was actually to spend less time on the face. This makes increasing social-cue weights across development seem like a poor description. In addition, children showed gradual improvement in fixating the target during both learning and test trials well into their fourth year. While children undeniably encounter more naming events over this period, it would seem unlikely that the process of learning the cue validity of social gaze would extend over such a long period of time. A better account of this phenomenon, then, seems to require an understanding of not only how cues are weighed, but also how children allocate their attention online when cues compete. 

To determine how perceptual salience and social cues interact, both during learning and at test, In Experiment 2 we manipulated the relative salience of the target and distractor objects to which children were exposed.


\section{Experiment 2}

\subsection{Method}

Experiment 2 was identical to Experiment 1 in all respects except for the identity of the novel toys that served as the target and distractor. In contrast to Experiment 1, in which the two toys were balanced in their visual salience, the two toys in Experiment 2 were intentionally mismatched. For children in the \emph{Salient} condition, the target was the more interesting toy, and the distractor the less interesting toy. In the \emph{Non-Salient} condition, the identities of the toys were switched---the target was the less salient toy. Thus, Experiment 2 allows us to investigate children's use of social cues to learn new words when they are aligned with salience, and when they are in opposition \cite<as in>{Hollich2000,Pruden2006}.

\subsubsection{Participants}

Participants were recruited from the floor of the San Jose Children's Discovery museum as in Experiment 1. This time, however, we focused on the three youngest age groups. In the Salience condition, demographic and experimental data were collected from 117 children, 52 of whom were excluded for one or more of the following reasons: abnormal developmental issues ($N= 13$), failure to calibrate ($N=25$), less than 75\% exposure to English ($N=33$), and inattentiveness ($N=2$). The final sample consisted of 22 1-1.5 year olds (11 girls), 21 1.5-2 year olds (10 girls), 19 2-2.5 year olds (9 girls). In the Non-Salience condition, data were collected from 126 children, 71 of whom were excluded for one or more of the following reasons: abnormal developmental issues ($N= 9$), failure to calibrate ($N=26$), and less than 75\% exposure to English ($N=36$). The final sample consisted of 26 1-1.5 year olds (13 girls), 25 1.5-2 year olds (11 girls), 15 2-2.5 year olds (4 girls).

\subsubsection{Stimuli, Design, and Procedure}

Experimental stimuli were identical to those in Experiment 1, except that the identities of the novel toys were changed and new videos were recorded. In addition, Novel and ME test trials were updated to reflect the novel objects used in Experiment 2. The procedure, including the order of the trials, was identical.

\end{figure*}


To determine the effect of perceptual salience on word learning, we compared children's looking in the Salient and Non-Salient conditions not only to each other, but also to the Balanced condition in Experiment 1. First, surprisingly, children's looking behavior during learning trials was not significantly affected by the salience of the target and distractor. As in Experiment 1, children of all ages spent the more time looking at the target than the distractor, but looking time to both made up the minority of their dwell time; children spent the majority of learning trials looking at the speaker's face.

However, salience exerted a strong effect on test trials---children in all age groups were strongly attracted to the salient object. When the target referent was salient, children at all ages looked at it for the majority of the window of analysis on Novel test trials (smallest $t(19)  = 2.96$, $p < .01$). When the target was non-salient, no age group look showed evidence of learning on Novel test trials (largest $t(13)  = 1.46$, $p = .17$). Mutual-exclusivity (ME) trials showed the opposite pattern. When the target referent was salient, children in the two younger age groups looked at the correct referent on ME trials (the competitor) at \emph{below} chance levels (smallest $t(20) = -2.29$, $p < .05$). In the Non-Salient condition, even the youngest children looked at the correct referent on ME trials at above chance levels (smallest $t(22) = 4.51$, $p < .001$). Figure~\ref{fig:exp1_2}) shows looking behavior in both Experiments 1 and 2 together.

A mixed-effects logistic regression fit to looking data from all three experiments showed a significant effect of age, a significant effect of experimental condition, a significant effect of trial type, and significant interactions between experiment and trial type, but interactions between experiment and age, trial type and age, or any three way interactions (Table~\ref{tab:model_table}). 

Together with the t-tests above, this analysis suggests that children are not learning to relative weights on salience and social cues over the course of development. While salience certainly plays a role in directing looking behavior, it does not appear to play a role during learning itself. Instead, salience appears to have a strong effect during test. In the absence of any social information, salience directs children's attention in a way that does not appear to change over early development.

\section{Conclusion}

Main ideas: face is relevant, attended to, and used to find the target. The reason why could change over development (e.g. face itself could be salient), but either way ``social cues'' get used.

Salience definitely matters, but mostly at test. Could be a cue-weighting model in which once the face is gone the salience cue gets high weight. But something about cue weighting seems wrong based on learning trial behavior. Unclear how to predict developmental differences unless cues are not normalized. Also, in general, this kind of model really misses the inherent temporal aspects of word learning.

Salience could still be used in the absence of social information for either smart or dumb reasons, and might end up being adaptive. But it seems pretty clear that we're not seeing a re-weighting across development of these two cues.

Seems like what we really want to pay attention to are memory, attentional control, and timing. Probably all of these are developing?

Maybe the two timescales idea \cite{Frank2009a,McMurray2012} is the right way to think about this kind of thing. Performing above competence?
